## brdist

Shows distance to party members to make things easier for support role jobs.

Consider using KenshiDRK's version of TParty instead, as it does nearly the same thing.

The text changes color past a configurable distance (default 9.9 yalms),
and optionally changes color again past max cast distance (20.5 yalms).
Distances to alliance members may also be shown.
