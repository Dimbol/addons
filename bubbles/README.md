Tracks alliance geomancy effects.

I made this to more easily avoid duplicating effects when playing with other geomancers.
It can also be used if you are just curious about what geomancers are doing.

Three optional output modes:
* faux party chat
* list in chatlog upon command
* colorful textbox HUD
